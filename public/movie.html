<h1>The Best Series According to Okkins</h1>

<h2>My top series of all-time</h2>

<hr />


<h3>The BigBang Theory</h3>
<p>Because it is the best sitcom out there. It features many relatable characters, endless memorable and hilarious moments, and an unforgettable on-going story.</p>

<h3>Friends</h3>
<p>The show especially teaches us about the subjects of love and friendship</p>

<h3>One Punch Man</h3>
<p>The story is about a bald superhero defeating every bad-ass enemy in his way with a single blow. The animation is spectacular (better than any anime made IMO), the jokes and puns are hilarious, most importantly the plot and pacing of the story is so fast and there are definitely zero windy/exaggerated moments scenes.</p>
